                On the first episode of Peppers with Phia, we're going to discuss the basics of preparing 
                pepper plants in February to be ready for planting in May. To start, we will discuss the 
            topic of seed starting. Remember, for extra tips and tricks, check out our <a>blog site</a>. 
        Now, seeds can be tricky. They are typically spread out by birds or other methods of fruit 
    transfer that allow the seeds to flourish in tropical areas. However, depending on your unique 
    bioregion, you may have to take extra steps to nourish young peppers under indoor care prior to 
    transplanting. First, you must find a good place for seed starting. This could be next to a sunny 
    window with plently of light, or you could invest in a grow light at a 25% setting to make sure your 
    seedling get plenty of light for photosynthesis. This is especially important in the early stages of 
    growth, as photosynthesis provides the nutrients that the seedling requires to develop its glucose and 
    starches. In addition, if the light will be coming from one particular angle, remember to rotate the 
    peat pots daily. Peppers are phototropic, meaning they will grow towards the light source. 
    So, they must be rotated to ensure even growth and promote the develop of strong stems. Next, you 
    will need to choose a potting mix. Typically, you would use a seed starting mix with peat moss. Peat 
    moss contains lots of nitrogen and nutrients that aid root development, which is the most important 
    part of a pepper's stability. You could also mix in the peat moss with some natural compost from your 
    garden to add extra nutrients. Then, fill up your peat pots with the potting mix, leaving about half 
    an inch of space on top for watering and to prevent overflow, and then sprinkle in your seeds about 1/8 
    of an inch deep. Then, you'll need to water the seeds using lukewarm water to moisten the soil. Be 
    wary of overwatering, which can result in root end rot and be fatal during the earliest stages of 
    root development. So, you can use a spray bottle or mini watering can to keep the soil moist, yet 
    not soggy. Then, an extra tip for more sunlight and warmth is an upside down plastic bottle. You 
    can cut a plastic water bottle in half and place the bottom of the bottle upside-down over some peat 
    pots to create a miniature greenhouse effect. This will simulate the tropical conditions that peppers 
    thrive in. This also aids the germination process. Don't give your plants chemical fertilizers, as 
    they can easily be too harsh and burn young roots. Instead, take a banana peel and dump it into a 
    blender with some water. Then, blend it up and use it as a natural fertilizer. It will contain potassium 
    and phosphorus, which are essential for healthy pepper growth. Well, that's about it for our first episode 
    on Peppers with Phia. Next time, we will discuss the best practices for hardening peppers in the Spring.
